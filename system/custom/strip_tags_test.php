<p>A  self-styled \"shit-kicker from Moston\" Lee Griffiths was discovered as a  youthful soul prodigy by Paul Morley in the late 90s and signed to ZTT  Records. After a spectacular falling-out with superstar producer Trevor  Horn, Lee disowned his debut album Northern Songs and returned in  disgust to civilian life in North Manchester. He finally began writing  and recording at home again in earnest while holding down a series of  low-paid jobs to keep the rent - and after five years 'Armchair Anarchy'  is the result.</p>

<p>40 years on from Sergeant  Pepper, \"Hippy Dippy\" is a sly, knowing nod to Sixties counterculture  over an insanely catchy groove. \"Scared\", recounts a late coming-out  after years of denial.&nbsp; But the album's centrepiece is perhaps the  acoustic showstopper \"Meet Me Halfwayz\". Lee's tender/tough delivery and  aching vulnerability make him Manchester's answer to Ray Lamontagne and  Jos&eacute; Gonzales.</p>

<p>Battered and broke - but back on  storming form - Lee Griffiths looks more like a prizefighter these days  than the pugnacious waif first signed by Horn and Morley for his  astonishing voice. And as word of his comeback begins to spread,  musicbiz movers and shakers in the know have been stepping forward to  lend a hand.</p>

<p>Ian Grimble (Manics, Texas,  Wannadies, Travis, etc) helped produce tracks for the new album. Take  That manager Nigel Nartin-Smith and Tom Robinson (2-4-6-8 Motorway) has  shot and edited two videos for the album, and Culture Club producer  Steve Levine has mixed the latest version of Meet Me Halfway free of  charge in his West London studio.&nbsp; Joseph Galliano is running a  three-page spread in July acclaiming Lee as the UK's next great gay  voice.</p>";
