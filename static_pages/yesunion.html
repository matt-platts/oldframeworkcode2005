Gonzo are proud to announce the release of Yes UNION in a Special Limited Edition Deluxe Package.</p>

<p>This concert film of the band was made on August 8th 1991 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. It was subsequently only released in Japan on video and then on the briefly new format of Laser Disc. This fantastic film however, was not widely available for a long time and has since become a much sought after artefact amongst Yes fans.</p>

<p>This exclusive deluxe package includes the original film from the Shoreline Amphitheatre (taken directly from the master tapes), reproduction tour program, deluxe "digi-pak" packaging, replica tour passes, along with a debut release of the soundtrack from the Shoreline Amphitheatre show, as a two CD set. If that wasn't enough, there also a bonus DVD featuring some bootleg footage of the band. It must be stressed however that the bootleg footage is raw and the sound and picture quality is not to the standard of normal commercial releases, but has been included for collectors and completists.</p>

<p>This disc also includes some bonus audio tracks, three of which are 5.1 and four are stereo mixes. The whole package comes housed in a slipcase with artwork approved by Roger Dean and is an official Yes release.</p>

<p>This deluxe package is strictly only available as a <strong>Limited Edition </strong>via this web site, no shops (not even Amazon) will be carrying this deluxe edition and as such will be sold on a first come, first served basis. There is stock in our warehouse waiting to be shipped the same day orders are received. Get yours now or be disappointed later!</p>
